    "# Summary of my week_one in Machine Learning Course with Arewa Data Science Fellowship.\n",
    "## Contents:\n",
    "### Introduction To Machine Learning.\n",
    "### History Of Machine Learning.\n",
    "### Fairness in Machine Learning.\n",
    "### Techniques in Machine learning.\n",
    "The course begin with pre-lecture quiz to test a fellows understanding on machine learning as a course which later ypu will be viewing the comprehensive lecture video from one of the MIT open soource lecture series on introduction to computational thinking and data science by instructor Eric Grimson, where he introduces machine learning and shows examples of supervised learning using features vectors.\n",
    "## INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING.\n",
    "Before starting the course, here are computer set up needed in my local system:\n",
    "- Python installed.\n",
    "- Basic understanding of python language.\n",
    "- Github Account.\n",
    "- Explore Scikit-learn.\n",
    "The content further explain the following concept: \n",
    "1. What is Machine Learning.\n",
    "2. The hype Curve from Google Trends. \n",
    "3. A mysterious nature of machine learning by comparing to child's and human brain in peicerving the facts within their surrounding and gradually learning the hidden patternsof life which help in crafting logical rules in identifying learned patterns.\n",
    "4. Some terminologies such as AI, ML and Deep learning. \n",
    "5. Why study Machine Learning since it motivation is loosely inspired by how the human brain learns certain thingd based on data it perceives from the outside world.\n",
    "6. Application of machine learning. \n",
    "7. Examples of Applied ML in:\n",
    " - Predicting the likelihood of disease from a patient's medical history.\n",
    " - Leveraging weather data to predict weather events.\n",
    " - Understanding sentiment analysis of a text.\n",
    " - Detecting fake news to stop the spread of propaganda.\n",
    "8. Inconlusion we rralised how machine learning automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insight from real-world or generated data.\n",
    "9. Take the post-lecture Quiz as required.\n",
    "## HISTORY OF MACHINE LEARNING. \n",
    "The lecture started with image summary of dates events and scenerious of machine learning history and the pre-lecture quiz as usual. \n",
    "### Notable Discoveries.\n",
    "- 1763-1812 Bayes Theorem: This describe the probability of an event occuring based on prior knoledge. \n",
    "- 1805 Least Square Theory:By Adrien-Marie Legendre, which help to learning regression and data fitting. \n",
    "- 1913 Markov Chains: By Andrey Markov, used to describe a sequence of possible events based on a previous state.\n",
    "- 1957 Perxeption: By Frank Rosenblatt, this underlies advances in deep learning.\n",
    "- 1967 Nearest Neighbor: is an algorithms originally designed to map routes but its now used in ML to detect patterns.\n",
    "- 1970 Backpropagation: Used to train feedforward neural networks.\n",
    "- 1982 Recurrent Neural Network: are AI neural network derived from feedback neural network to create temporal graphs. \n",
    "### Recent Discoveries.\n",
    "- 1950 Machine that think: By Alan Turing, which explored in NLP Profession. \n",
    "- 1956 Dartmouth summer Research project: lead by John McCarthy hoped \"to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely describe that a machine can be made to simulate it.\"\n",
    "- 1956-1974 The golden years: The research were well funded by governmnent during this years and advances were made in computation and algoriths, prototypes of intelligent machine were built which include:\n",
    "  - shakey the robot.\n",
    "  - Eliza\n",
    "  - Blocks world .\n",
    " - 1974-1980 AI winter:it become complexity of making intelligent machine due to funding dried up and lacks of confidences as such lead to:\n",
    "   - Limitations\n",
    "   - Combinatorial explosion.\n",
    "   - paucity of data\n",
    " - 1980s Expert systems: it was the first truly successful forms of AI software. Also, this era saw increasing attention paid to neural networks.\n",
    " - 1987-1993 AI chill: proliferation of specialized experts system and rise of personal computers to compete with large, specialized and centralized system. \n",
    " - 1993-2011: This epoch saw a new era for ML and AI to be able to solve some of the problems that had been caused earlier by the lack of data and computer power. \n",
    " - Now, machine learning and AI touch almost every parts of our life. \n",
    " ## FAIRNESS IN  MACHINE LEARNING.\n",
    " The courses expose me to responsible AI principles which tittle the potential of AI presented by microsoft chief scientific officer Eric Horvitz. Moreover, i learned and explored the underlisted topics :\n",
    " - unfairness in data and algorithms as one of the sociotechnogical challenges. \n",
    " - fairness-related harms which are classified as:\n",
    "   - Allocation\n",
    "   - Quality of service\n",
    "   - Stereotyping\n",
    "   - Denigration\n",
    "   - Over-or-under representation\n",
    " - how to detect unfairness in machine learning by using the patterns in resumes received. \n",
    " - how to understand models and build in fairness.\n",
    " - how to assesst the machine learning fairness using methods sucha as:\n",
    "   - identifying the harms\n",
    "   - identying the affected groups\n",
    "   - the define the fainess metrics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - how to mitigate unfairness\n",
    "  - Expose to fairlearn,which is an open source python package that allows to assess systems fairness and mitigate unfairness. \n",
    "  ## TECHNIQUES IN MACHINE LEARNING.\n",
    "  This involved the process of building, using and maintaining machine learning models and data use is a very different process from many other development workflows. However, the course start with introduction which craft a processed of machine learning as comprised: \n",
    "  1. Decide on the Question\n",
    "  2. collect and prepare data\n",
    "  3. choose a training method\n",
    "  4. Train the model\n",
    "  5. Evaluate the model\n",
    "  6. Parameter tuning\n",
    "  7. prediction\n",
